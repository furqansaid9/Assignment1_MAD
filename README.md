# Using List in Flutter

In this assignment, I will create:

1) a flutter app

2) create an object with hard coded list of items, for example apple, orange, rambutan...

3) Create a textbox widget to enter a choice of 1,2,3,or ...

4) Create a button to access the list and display the content of the list depending on what was chosen on the textbox. 

So if 1 is entered in the textbox, than, display apple.
